<b>Visualization challenges</b>

<b>Create an app that layers NASA mission data on solar system data to visualize space missions (difficult)</b>
<br>SPICE toolkit for positioning of planets and spacecrafts. <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html"> http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html</a>

<b>Oculus VR / LEAP / Google Cardboard app to visualize DU (difficult)</b>
<br>The data in DU naturally lends itself to the Oculus VR environment. The goal of this challenge is to build an app that interfaces with the Oculus Rift to visualize for Oculus-capable applications.

<b>Visualize dark matter (difficult)</b>
<br>How do you visualize something that cannot be seen?
Use this trillion particle simulation of the large scale structure of the universe to visualize how dark matter is distributed in the universe. It illustrates the evolution of the universe from the small fluctuations we see in the cosmic microwave background to today's cosmic structures, 13.7 billion years later. http://darksky.slac.stanford.edu/

<b>Space flight dashboard (moderate)</b>
<br>Create a dashboard for Digital Universe that track realtime and spacetime variables as you navigate the universe. eg lightyear distances versus lookback time. Speed, position, time since Big Bang.  

<b>Eyes on Earth (moderate)</b>
<br>Create an app that visualizes Earth observing satellite positions and describes each satellite's functionality. Could be built outside of DU or in collaboration with a group creating a solar system within DU. Satellite positioning data http://www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/.

<b>How far out into space have humans left their mark? (easy)</b>
<br>For example: human spacetravel, man-made objects, first radio waves, first artificial light (electricity/fire), etc.
Variation: Create an interactive quiz that poses and answers questions such as: What news broadcast from earth would you hear today at Alpha Centauri?
