<b>Education challenges</b>

<b>Create a graphical interface to visualize light-years / space-time / look-back in time

<b>Mobile app to tour Hall of the Universe

<b>Expansion of the universe </b>
<br>Since the universe expands at (approx.) 74.2 km/sec for very megaparsec (3.25  million light years), the app could take input as to how many megaparsecs out one wants to go and it could generate the expansion at that point.

<b>Space weather</b>
<br>Take input as to date (current or any time in the future) and show the seasons on a particular planet.

<b>Solar activity</b>
<br>Take historical data (this year, last five years, etc.) and show occurrence of sunspots over time. To odel the total solar cycle, consider an 11 year time frame. 

<b>Project orbits onto a surface</b>
<br>Create an app that allows visitors control the mass and velocity of objects in orbits projected onto a surface. Using a wifi system or accelerometer to track movements, the floor could be marked off in “light years” illustrating various locations: the Milky Way, Andromeda, etc. As you move from one object to another in your virtual space ship, it tells you how fast you would be going: “You’re moving 100 times the speed of light! That’s impossible!” 

<b>Cosmic weight loss app</b>
<br>Set your target weight and learn which planet you need to move to achieve that weight without exercise or dieting! Unfortunately there may be some drawbacks to your new phone: sulfuric acid rain on Venus, no oxygen on Mars, etc.

<b>Make a scale solar system that actually fits in the hall</b>
<br>Mount some objects for the sun and planets; the sun would be about the size of a golf ball maybe, and the planets could literally be grains of sand, dust, poppy seeds, etc. Then create an app that uses augmented reality to magnify them when you approach.
