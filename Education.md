<b>Mobile app to tour Hall of the Universe

<b>Look back time</b>
<br>We see light coming from stars that left (X) light years ago. In the same way, those stars RIGHT NOW will see light (including radio waves) that left Earth (x) light years ago. Create an app that would allow the student to click on a star, and then show the user what was happening on earth when that star light we see now left that star, which is also what an astronomer on that star would be seeing if they looked at us now.
Now in this case, we imagine they have a really strong telescope/instruments which allow them to hear music, see television footage, and experience historical events. They might see an interesting fact, or hear a song from that era, or even a piece of art.
<br><b>Examples</b>: <i>Deneb – 808 light years away</i>, so they would see earth as it was in 1206. One big event is the start of the reign of genghis khan.
<i>Vega – 25 light years away</i>, so 1989. They would just be seeing the fall of the Berlin Wall and could hear an appropriate song from the late 80’s.
<br>Do it for the brightest/closest 100 stars, and maybe bin it into 50 year chunks for further away stars.

<b>True motion of stars in constellations</b>
<br>We connect lines between stars in constellations to make a picture in the sky like the bull Taurus, or swan Cygnus. But those stars usually are not connected in any way and have their own proper motions and distances from earth. Over time (10,000-millions of years) their position would change in our night sky, ruining our nice “picture”/constellation.
The app allows users to chose a constellation, with the stick figure lines attached between the stars. They can then move time forward and backward to see the stars move relative to each other. At any point, they can remove the lines, and redraw their own to make a new constellation (or asterism) of their own design.

<b>Expansion of the universe </b>
<br>Since the universe expands at (approx.) 74.2 km/sec for very megaparsec (3.25  million light years), the app could take input as to how many megaparsecs out one wants to go and it could generate the expansion at that point.

<b>Space weather</b>
<br>Take input as to date (current or any time in the future) and show the seasons on a particular planet.

<b>Solar activity</b>
<br>Take historical data (this year, last five years, etc.) and show occurrence of sunspots over time. To odel the total solar cycle, consider an 11 year time frame. 

<b>Project orbits onto a surface</b>
<br>Create an app that allows visitors control the mass and velocity of objects in orbits projected onto a surface. Using a wifi system or accelerometer to track movements, the floor could be marked off in “light years” illustrating various locations: the Milky Way, Andromeda, etc. As you move from one object to another in your virtual space ship, it tells you how fast you would be going: “You’re moving 100 times the speed of light! That’s impossible!” 

<b>Cosmic weight loss app</b>
<br>Set your target weight and learn which planet you need to move to achieve that weight without exercise or dieting! Unfortunately there may be some drawbacks to your new phone: sulfuric acid rain on Venus, no oxygen on Mars, etc.

<b>Make a scale solar system that actually fits in the hall</b>
<br>Mount some objects for the sun and planets; the sun would be about the size of a golf ball maybe, and the planets could literally be grains of sand, dust, poppy seeds, etc. Then create an app that uses augmented reality to magnify them when you approach.
